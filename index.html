        <h4 id="intro">Introduction:
        </h4>
        <p>
            Hong Kong is a city in the east coast of China. It has many environmental issues
            such as air quality, deforestation and today's focus: Waste Management.
            Each household in Hong Kong generates 1.27kg per person.
            In this article, we will explore the causes effects, and problems that arise with Hong Kong, and 
            its many issues with waste.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Types of Waste:
        </h4>
        <p>
            Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is the common household waste, like plastics, food, packaging, paper and other thing.
            Another type of waste that is not included in MSW is construction waste.
            According to earth.org the distributions for Hong Kong are:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Construction Waste: 25%</li>
            <li>Food Waste (MSW): 30%</li>
            <li>Paper waste (MSW): 24%</li>
            <li>Plastic Waste (MSW): 21%</li>
            <li>Others: 3%</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Causes and Effects of Waste in Hong Kong: </h4>
        <p>
            Poor waste management in Hong Kong is caused by many issues in the city, according to the 
            Hong Kong Environment Bureau, these are the key factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Limited Space: </b>Land is very scarce and expensive to establish recycling companies.</li>
            <li><b>Landfills: </b> The landfill infrastructure in Hong Kong is not good, and difficult to maintain.
            also, the city is over-relying on them, which causes many issues with waste management.
         </li>
         <li><b>Public Trust: </b>People have doubts about the government actually trying to resolve the issue, because of the 
        low amounts of recycling bins in the city. There have been rumours that people are not actually recycling the waste in the bins.</li>

        </ul>
        <p> Also, waste management has an impact on the environment. According to Fo Ching Ma, in a research article about Hong Kong, the main environmental issues
            caused by waste management are:
        </p>
        <ul><li><b>Contamination:</b> Because of the amount of waste, the land and ground water are being infected and contaminated with waste.</li>
        <li><b>Climate Change:</b> The waste produces a lot of greenhouse gasses, which contribute to climate change.</li></ul>

        <h4>
            What the Government Achieved: 
        </h4>
        <p>According to earth.org, the government has been trying to get the daily MSW rates to be 0.8kg per household. To do that, they 
            have attempted to try these things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ban foreign trash:</b> Before 2018, 50% of all plastic, paper and metal waste was dumped into China, however, they made a law which now bans
                foreign garbage.
            </li>
            <li><b>Waste Incineration Plants: </b>Waste incineration plants are factories which burn the trash, and use the excess gasses for electricity. China has
            planned 4 waste incineration plants. But the project was shut down due to complaints about air quality. However, today we have new carbon-capture technology,
        which could filter the bad air, so the projects are being renewed in 2025.</li>
        <li><b>More Recycling:</b> Around 10% of the plastic waste in Hong Kong is recycled. There are many corporations, like EcoPark, which recycle a small amount of plastic waste
        However, the plastic being recycled is not enough. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Solutions that could work:</h4>
        <p>To see what solutions would work, let's see how other cities handle their waste: </p>
        <h5>How does Singapore Handle waste? </h5>
        <p>According to the video, "How Singapore Handles 6 Million Pound of Trash Daily", 42% of the trash is burned in the 
            same waste incineration plants that China is planning to use. Let's see some advantages and disadvantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Electricity:</b> Burning the trash generates enough electricity to power 240 000 houses! This is reusing waste
            to generate a more sustainable source of electricity,</li>
            <li><b>Excess Gas:</b>After the burning is done, the gas is filtered with the carbon-capture technology, and monitored to keep within the 
            emission rates</li>
            <li><b>Excess Ash: </b> Unfortunately, there is nothing to do with the extra ash that is made from burning that much trash. The ash is dumped on an island
            which is almost 90% full. Singapore is planning to use another island as a landfill, and are currently looking for a solution to renew this ash.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How does Seoul Handle Waste? </h5>
        <p>Seoul, capital of South Korea, has prioritized waste reduction, and has some of the most strictest waste policies in the world, 
            let's take a look at some solutions that Seoul handles it's waste (Henam, Sonia):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>VBWF: </b>One of the main policies that Seoul used to reduce waste was Volume-Based Waste Disposal Fees or VBWF. Now
                all citizens need to pay for throwing away food waste based on the volume and/or weight of the waste.</li>
                <li><b>Separate Waste Collection: </b>In 1991, it was required that all citizens collect types of waste separately, like 1 bag for
                plastic, 1 bag for food waste, 1 bag for glass, etc. This helped increase recycling rates, and made recycling more convenient, because companies didn't
            have to separate the waste anymore.</li>
            <li><b>Fines for Violation: </b>If you violate garbage disposal laws, like you don't collect your garbage separately, or litter in the city,
            you could face fines up to 1 000$!</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>In Conclusion, Hong Kong could try to make incineration plants, but it only delays the waste process, as there are still no ways
            to recycle the ash. A much better solution would be to install fees like South Korea, and increase recycling by communicating better with the citizens,
            using social media, local news or other means. Together, the city could contribute to making a more sustainable planet.
